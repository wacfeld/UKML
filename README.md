# ULTRAKILL Mustn't Live

My take on the currently unreleased ULTRAKILL Must Die difficulty.
Work in progress.

## Usage

All changes are applied universally.
Therefore to play the new difficulty, simply select Brutal difficulty with the mod installed.
Of course, you can play the mod on lower difficulties as well, if you want to experience the behavioural changes without the ludicrous speed.

## Current features

All changes are relative to Brutal difficulty

# ULTRAKILL Mustn't Live

My take on the currently unreleased ULTRAKILL Must Die difficulty.
Work in progress.

## Current features

- Hard damage multiplier set to 100%

## Installation

- Install [BepInEx](https://thunderstore.io/c/ultrakill/p/BepInEx/BepInExPack/) if you don't have it already
- Go to the latest [Release](https://github.com/wacfeld/UKML/releases)
- Download the dll and move it to `ULTRAKILL/BepInEx/plugins`

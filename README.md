# ULTRAKILL Mustn't Live

My take on the currently unreleased ULTRAKILL Must Die difficulty.
Work in progress.

## Usage

At the moment, (almost) all changes are applied universally.
Therefore to play the new difficulty, simply select Brutal difficulty with the mod installed.
A proper difficulty selection screen is coming in a future update.

## Current features

All changes are relative to Brutal difficulty

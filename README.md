# ULTRAKILL Mustn't Live

My take on the currently unreleased ULTRAKILL Must Die difficulty.
Work in progress.

## Current features

- Hard damage multiplier set to 100%

## Installation

- Install [BepInEx](https://thunderstore.io/c/ultrakill/p/BepInEx/BepInExPack/) if you don't have it already
- Go to the latest [Release](https://github.com/wacfeld/UKML/releases)
- Download the dll and move it to `ULTRAKILL/BepInEx/plugins`

## Usage

At the moment, (almost) all changes are applied on top of the existing Brutal difficulty.
Therefore to play the new difficulty, simply select Brutal from the menu with the mod installed.
A proper difficulty selection screen is coming in a future update.

## 0.5.0 - 2025-04-23

- Guttertanks enrage when their punches whiff
- Enraged Guttertanks fire enraged rockets, which have a much larger explosion
  - Enraged rocket explosions can be mitigated by shooting them with a hitscan weapon, or hitting them with an impact hammer
- Guttertanks will start projectile-boosting mines at the player when the freezeframe is active
  - The projectile-boost animation is like a regular Guttertank punch except that it can be parried, can't enraged the Guttertank, and can't make the Guttertank slip
- Mines can be parried multiple times
- Mines that were parried by someone other than the player can collide with the player
- Mines not parried by the player will not damage enemies (but can still light susceptible enemies on fire)
